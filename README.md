## üîç Overview
Restful-booker is a Create Read Update Delete Web API that comes with authentication features and loaded with a bunch of bugs for you to explore. The API comes pre-loaded with 10 records for you to work with and resets itself every 10 minutes back to that default state. Restful-booker also comes with detailed API documentation to help get you started with your API testing straight away.

 - As part of checking my practical skills in API testing, I tested one of the endpoints. There is an exposed API for testing training purposes at https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/.
Documentation can be found at: https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html. Using the API and documentation, I conducted tests and prepared a report for enpoint: UpdateBooking ( https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html#api-Booking-UpdateBooking )

- I used the Postman to carry out the tests and prepare the report.
